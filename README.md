# Linear Magnetic Hall Sensors

#### Project Overview

The **Linear Magnetic Hall Sensors** project demonstrates how to use a Hall effect sensor with an Arduino Mega to measure magnetic field strength. This project reads the analog voltage from the Hall sensor and prints the magnetic field strength values to the Serial Monitor. Based on a defined threshold, it determines whether the magnetic field is strong or weak.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **Linear Magnetic Hall Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Hall Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Hall Sensor Pin:** Connect to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Mega.
   - **VCC:** Connect to 5V on Arduino.
   - **GND:** Connect to GND on Arduino.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the Hall sensor to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

3. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for the magnetic field strength values printed as sensor readings.
   - The Serial Monitor will also display whether a strong or weak magnetic field is detected based on the defined threshold.

#### Applications

- **Magnetic Field Detection:** Measure magnetic field strength for various applications.
- **Position Sensing:** Detect the position of a magnet in linear or rotational systems.
- **Proximity Sensing:** Implement magnetic-based proximity sensing in industrial or consumer applications.

#### Notes

- Ensure the Hall sensor is exposed to the magnetic field you intend to measure.
- Calibrate readings as needed based on environmental conditions and sensor placement.
- Experiment with different thresholds to optimize sensitivity and range.
